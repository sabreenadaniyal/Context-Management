# 🧠 Context Management in Agentic AI

## 📌 Overview
Context management is a powerful concept in both **Python** and **Agentic AI**.  
In Python, it ensures resources are set up and cleaned up automatically using the `with` statement.  
In Agentic AI, context management ensures that the AI agent retains, updates, and cleans up relevant information during task execution — enabling **accurate reasoning, better resource control, and consistent decision-making**.

This project demonstrates **Local Context Management** in three real-world scenarios:
1. **Bank Account Context** 🏦
2. **Student Profile Context** 🎓
3. **Library Book Context** 📚

Additionally, the project integrates **logging** and **traceability** to monitor actions and maintain a clear record of all operations.

## 🚀 Features
- **LLM Context Management**: Handles long-term knowledge for agents.
- **Local Context Management**: Manages temporary, task-specific information.
- **Logging** 📝: Tracks every action and decision made by the agent.
- **Traceability** 🔍: Allows step-by-step review of agent behavior.
- **Three Practical Examples**:
  - **Bank Account Context**: Secure deposits and withdrawals.
  - **Student Profile Context**: Manage student records with ID, semester, name, and total courses.
  - **Library Book Context**: Manage books with ID, title, author, and availability status.
